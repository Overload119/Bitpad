<h1>BitPad</h1>

BitPad is a Ruby on Rails app that showcases bitpad.js.

<h3>Background</h3>
I've been meaning to play around with a canvas editor that can draw pixelated images and then animate them. At the same time, I wanted to setup Rails on my Windows PC which I have been told is a drag. This is my first app built fully from scratch using Ruby on Rails, on a Windows machine.

<h3>Features</h3>
Check out all the features <a href="http://bitpad.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

* The BitPad.js file contains a jQuery widget (the focus of this app) that is ready to be experimented with
* Convert any `<canvas>` element into a BitPad which is an editor for drawing scalable pixelated graphics
* Images created in BitPad can be loaded and saved with a built-in encoding that reduces filesize images by up to 99% (compared to equivelent .png file)
* Images created in BitPad can be scaled 'perfectly'
* Export BitPad images as .pngs or use the custom encoding for efficiency
